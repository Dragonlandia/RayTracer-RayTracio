## About
This project is a simple Ray Tracer created with help of RayTracing in a week. This is my first project that involves RayTracing, 
so I am opened for any suggestions about optimizing and stuff like that. I hope to use this knowledge in my game engine.\
Please, do note that this project is Wndows Only!

## The Plan
The plan is to make a powerfull Runtime Raytracer, but as for now I am just adding small optimizations and fixes.\

Check List of features:
- [ ] Add Multithreading;
- [ ] Complete and easy to use API;
- [ ] Runtime;
